# Task 23 Completion Summary

## Task: Integrate all components in App.tsx

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Implementation Details

### 1. App.tsx Integration

Successfully integrated all components in the main App component:

- **Desktop Component**: Imported and rendered as the main container
- **Window Components**: Rendered dynamically from window store state using `.map()`
- **Taskbar Component**: Rendered to show minimized windows
- **ThemeSwitcher Component**: Rendered for theme selection
- **SkipLink Component**: Added for accessibility
- **KeyboardShortcutsHelp Component**: Added for keyboard navigation help
- **ErrorBoundary Component**: Wrapped entire app for error handling

### 2. Icon Configuration

The Desktop component internally uses `iconConfigs` from `src/config/icons.tsx`, which includes:

- About Me
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact

Each icon configuration includes window content, title, default size, and minimum size.

### 3. Window Store Integration

Connected all window store actions to Window components:

- `closeWindow` - Close window action
- `minimizeWindow` - Minimize window action
- `maximizeWindow` - Maximize window action
- `restoreWindow` - Restore window action
- `focusWindow` - Focus window action
- `updateWindowPosition` - Update position during drag
- `updateWindowSize` - Update size during resize

### 4. Theme Initialization

- Used `useTheme()` hook in App component to initialize theme on mount
- Theme is automatically loaded from localStorage via the hook
- CSS variables are applied to `:root` by the theme store

### 5. Lazy Loading

Implemented `Suspense` wrapper for window content components:

- Content components are lazy-loaded for better performance
- Custom loading fallback with themed styling
- Matches window position and size during loading

### 6. Global Styles (index.css)

Set up comprehensive global styles:

**CSS Variables:**

- All theme colors as CSS custom properties
- Default theme (Sakura Dreams) values
- Variables are dynamically updated by theme store

**Typography:**

- Font family: Quicksand, Nunito, Comfortaa with system fallbacks
- Base font size: 16px
- Heading styles (h1-h6) with proper weights and colors
- Link styles with theme colors

**Base Styles:**

- Box-sizing reset
- Body styles with overflow hidden
- Focus styles for accessibility
- Custom scrollbar styling with theme colors

**Optimizations:**

- Font rendering optimizations
- Smooth transitions
- Proper focus indicators

### 7. App-Level Styles (App.css)

Simplified App.css to essential layout:

- Full viewport width and height
- Overflow hidden for desktop environment
- Relative positioning for absolute-positioned windows

## Verification

✅ Build successful - No TypeScript errors
✅ All components properly imported
✅ Window store actions connected
